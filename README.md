## Introduction

During my study of Flutter, I have been using the flutter_bloc state management framework. I accidentally saw the GetX state management framework. Through ReadMe, I found that the GetX framework is very easy to get started. So I want to write a GetX Starter project while learning, which can not only help myself Learning can also help others quickly build a boilerplate. Before building this boilerplate, I searched many similar projects, and found that they were relatively simple, and none of them covered the common things that the project should have, so I sprouted the idea of ​​writing one by myself. Let me introduce them one by one below.

## Technology & Project Introduction

Use Flutter 2.x to build a set of features containing predefined folder structure, style themes, API access, state management, routing & dependencies, etc. The project structure is clear and can be easily used as a Flutter template project. Technologies used include but are not limited to [Flutter](https://flutter.cn/), [Dart](https://dart.dev/), [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get), etc.

**Step 1:**

Fork this project to your own warehouse:

```
git clone https://github.com/KevinZhang19870314/flutter_getx_boilerplate.git
```

**Step 2:**

Open the project folder with VS Code and execute the following command to install the dependency package:

```
flutter pub get
```

**Step 3:**

Open the main.dart file in the lib folder, F5 or Ctrl + F5 to run the project, and then you can start developing and debugging.
